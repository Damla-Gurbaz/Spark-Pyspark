Eventually the centers of the galaxies will merge, and the gas pouring toward the center will ignite an explosion of star formation, producing stars more than 100 times faster than either galaxy does today. It will also feed the now quiet supermassive black holes that lurk at the centers of both galaxies. The black holes will grow while releasing a storm of energetic particles and radiation that will easily outshine the light from all the stars in both galaxies combined. After another 100 million years or so, the two supermassive black holes will spiral toward each other and merge into a single black hole in a cataclysm that will send strong gravitational waves reverberating throughout space.
Despite the fireworks, this process—which is happening around us today and was even more common in the early universe—is not really a “collision” in the strictest sense of the word. Galaxies are mostly empty space. The roughly 300 billion stars in a galaxy like the Milky Way are, on average, separated by nearly five light-years. The density of air at sea level on Earth is about 100 million billion times greater than the average density of gas in interstellar space. In other words, although a merger is transformative in the life of a galaxy and a source of immense power, most stars just pass right by one another during the event.Nevertheless, galaxy pileups are fascinating and important. By studying the mergers of other galaxies, we can see the future of our own. Studying galaxy mergers also helps us understand the history of the universe because when the cosmos was younger and denser, galactic collisions were much more common. Simulations suggest that over the past 10 billion years the Milky Way has undergone as many as five major mergers on its way to becoming the grand spiral it is today.
